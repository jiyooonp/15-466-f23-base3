# Tobby's Candy Catch

Author: Jiyoon Park

Design: In this game, Tobby's mission is to collect flying candy, but there's a twist! The candy makes a sound and flies in a straight line along the x-axis, but it remains invisible until it gets close to Tobby. Players must rely on their keen sense of hearing and quick reflexes to move Tobby to the right location and catch the candy before it's too late.
